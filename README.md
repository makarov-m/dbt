Welcome to my repository showcasing my journey through the dbt Fundamentals course. In this course, I learned essential skills and practices for data modeling and transformation using dbt (Data Build Tool) with Snowflake. This repository contains my work and progress throughout the course.

## ðŸ“‹ Course Overview

The course covered the following key topics:

1. **Creating a Snowflake Worksheet**: I learned how to create a new Snowflake worksheet, which is the starting point for data analysis and modeling.

2. **Loading Sample Data**: I loaded sample data into my Snowflake account to practice working with real datasets.

3. **Connecting dbt Cloud to Snowflake**: I established a connection between dbt Cloud and Snowflake, enabling seamless integration for data modeling.

4. **Creating dbt Models**: I transformed sample queries into dbt models. Each model represents a select statement and plays a crucial role in the data transformation process.

5. **Adding Sources**: I added sources to my dbt project, allowing me to name and describe the raw data already loaded into Snowflake. This step ensures data lineage and clear documentation.

6. **Implementing Tests**: I integrated tests into my dbt models to validate the accuracy and integrity of the data transformations.

7. **Documentation**: I documented my dbt models, making it easier for team members to understand the purpose and usage of each model.

8. **Scheduling Jobs**: I scheduled jobs to run my dbt transformations automatically, ensuring that my data stays up-to-date and relevant.
